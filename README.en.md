## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun run setup:chatgpt-web
bun run build
bun run start
```

ChatGPT Web ordinary-quota fallback requires Python 3.10+. The setup command creates a project-local environment at `runtime/chatgpt-web-venv` on first run and only updates it when the requirements change or imports are missing. See [ChatGPT Web Python runtime](docs/chatgpt-web-python-runtime.md).

Open:

- User workspace: http://127.0.0.1:8787
- Admin console: http://127.0.0.1:8787/config
- Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/health

For development, run backend and frontend dev servers separately:

```bash
bun run dev:api
bun run dev:web
```

## 🧑‍💻 First Use

For first-time setup, the CPA route is recommended because it is simple to configure and works well with account-pool and quota synchronization.

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/config`.
2. Initialize the admin password.
3. The CPA channel is recommended because it is simple to configure and quick to connect. You can also use an OpenAI-compatible API, ChatGPT Web route, or private image endpoint if needed.
4. If you use a CPA account pool, configure the CPA sync URL and credentials, enable sync, and run one manual sync first so accounts, quotas, and availability are imported.
5. Configure text models in the model settings section. These models power prompt optimization, title generation, daily inspiration copy, safety review, and other assistant-side features. Recommended model: `deepseek-v4-flash`.
6. Create user accounts, or enable registration according to your deployment needs.
7. Return to the user workspace, sign in with a user account, and start generating or editing images.

## 🖌️ User Workspace

The user workspace is for image creation and asset management:

- 💬 Conversational text-to-image generation.
- ✏️ Continue editing from existing images.
- 🖼️ Upload local images as references.
- 🗂️ Choose reference assets from the asset library.
- 🕘 View chat history and generated images.
- ⭐ Favorite, download, preview, and manage generated images.
- 💡 Add selected images to inspiration cases.
- 🧱 Use prompt templates to generate structured prompts.
- 👥 Manage personal and shared assets.

## ⚙️ Admin Console

The admin console is available at `/config` and is for administrators and deployment maintainers:

- 👤 Manage users, teams, and account status.
- 🎛️ Configure image providers, models, sizes, qualities, routing modes, and retry settings.
- 🔀 Manage CPA, ChatGPT Web, API, and other image channels.
- 🧮 Manage account pools, quota refresh, and request logs.
- 📮 Configure proxy, email, SMS, registration, and password reset settings.
- 🧰 Manage inspiration cases, shared asset review, and branding assets.
- 📊 View admin audit logs, image request logs, and model request logs.
- 🕹️ Adjust global switches and selected runtime settings.

## 💾 Runtime Data

The app creates a local `data/` directory:

- `data/app.db`: users, chats, images, assets, cases, and business data.
- `data/config.db`: admin password, providers, secrets, account pools, proxy, email/SMS settings.
- `data/files/`: generated images, uploaded assets, masks, and reference images.

When migrating or backing up the app, back up the entire `data/` directory.

## 📦 Release Packages

Official versions provide the following packages in GitHub Releases:

| Type | Platform / Arch | Package | Format | Startup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portable runtime | Windows x64 | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-windows-x64-portable.zip` | zip + exe | Unzip, open the `shenbi-maliang` directory, and double-click `ShenbiMaliang.exe` |
| Portable runtime | Windows ARM64 | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-windows-arm64-portable.zip` | zip + exe | For Windows ARM devices. Unzip, open the `shenbi-maliang` directory, and double-click `ShenbiMaliang.exe` |
| Portable runtime | Linux x64 | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-linux-x64-portable.zip` | zip + executable | Unzip, open the `shenbi-maliang` directory, then run `chmod +x ./shenbi-maliang && ./shenbi-maliang` |
| Portable runtime | Linux ARM64 | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-linux-arm64-portable.zip` | zip + executable | For ARM64/aarch64 servers, NAS devices, or development boards. Unzip, open the `shenbi-maliang` directory, then run `chmod +x ./shenbi-maliang && ./shenbi-maliang` |
| Portable runtime | macOS Intel | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-macos-x64-portable.zip` | zip + executable | Unzip, open the `shenbi-maliang` directory, then run `chmod +x ./shenbi-maliang && ./shenbi-maliang` |
| Portable runtime | macOS Apple Silicon | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-macos-arm64-portable.zip` | zip + executable | Unzip, open the `shenbi-maliang` directory, then run `chmod +x ./shenbi-maliang && ./shenbi-maliang` |
| Source run package | Windows / Linux / macOS | `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-source-run.zip` | zip + source | Run `start-update.bat` on Windows, or `bash ./start.sh` on Linux/macOS |

`shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-source-run.zip` does not include an executable, `node_modules`, or build output and requires Bun. ChatGPT Web ordinary-quota fallback additionally requires Python 3.10+; CPA, API, and Codex Responses routes remain available without it. You can also run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run setup:chatgpt-web`, `bun run build`, and `bun run start` manually. GitHub Releases also provide the raw `Source code (zip)` and `Source code (tar.gz)` automatically. Use `git clone` if you want the full repository history. Runtime data is created in `data/`. Back up `data/` before upgrading.

## 🔄 Updating a Release Build

If you deploy with any `portable.zip` package, update with the new portable package for the same platform and architecture. Do not overwrite a portable deployment directly with the `source-run` package.

Recommended update flow:

1. Stop the running program: `ShenbiMaliang.exe` on Windows, or `shenbi-maliang` on Linux/macOS.
2. Back up the old deployment's `data/` directory. It contains users, settings, account pools, images, assets, and history.
3. Extract the new `portable.zip` into a temporary directory.
4. Copy the files that need to be updated from the new `shenbi-maliang/` directory into your existing deployment directory.
5. Start the updated program from the original deployment directory and confirm that `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and `/config` open correctly.
6. After confirming the data is normal, delete the temporary extraction directory.

Usually, you only need to replace these runtime files:

- Platform executable: `ShenbiMaliang.exe` on Windows, or `shenbi-maliang` on Linux/macOS.
- `dist/`
- `distribution/codex-marketplace/`: templates required for Codex plugin installation and online updates.

If the release notes mention dependency updates, or if startup, upload, or image processing fails with `sharp` / native module errors, also replace:

- `node_modules/`

These files are included as documentation or helper files. They are not required for a portable runtime update, but you can sync them when needed:

- `README.md`
- `README.en.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `RUNNING.md`
- `package.json`
- `bun.lock`
- `scripts/`

Do not delete these files, and do not overwrite them with empty directories from a new package:

- `data/`: local databases, admin settings, account pools, user data, generated images, uploaded assets, and mask files are stored here.
- `.env` or any local environment files, startup scripts, reverse proxy settings, or other deployment files you created.
- Backup directories, log directories, or other custom files you keep manually.

The `shenbi-maliang-X.Y.Z-source-run.zip` package is updated differently: keep the old `data/` directory and local custom settings, replace the source files, then run `start-update.bat`, or manually run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run setup:chatgpt-web`, `bun run build`, and `bun run start`. The startup flow reuses or updates `runtime/chatgpt-web-venv`. The `node_modules/` and `dist/` directories in a source-run deployment are generated at runtime, so you do not need to copy them from the old version manually.
